# Our pledge to the open source community

Kong Gateway is not only an awesome open source project, but also part
of the product offering of Kong Inc.  We have a large team of product
people, software developers, testers and release engineers working on
Kong Gateway.  We make many of the enhancements to Kong Gateway in the
Community Edition, so our open source community directly benefits from
the commercial work that we do.

Recognizing that we operate as a commercial entity, we face the
challenge of balancing our commercial interests with the desire to
accommodate and support open source users and contributors
effectively.

## Response time to GitHub issues and pull requests

In the Kong Gateway team, we're committed to maintaining a rapid and
timely response to community contributions, promising to acknowledge
and engage within a dedicated timeframe of 10 working days. It is
important to note, however, that while we strive to be as responsive
as possible, we may not always be able to offer immediate solutions to
every reported problem or incorporate every submitted pull request
into the product.

## Maintaining an active working set

We will be closing pull requests or issue reports when we made the
decision that we will not be able to merge or resolve them in the
foreseeable future.  We do that in the interest of keeping our working
set manageable, as accumulating pull requests and issues which don't
make progress does not help improving Kong Gateway in the long run.

We automatically close issues and pull requests for which we do not
get responses to our questions or update requests within 3 weeks.
