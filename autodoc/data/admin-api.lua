          This page refers to the Admin API for running Kong configured with a
          database (Postgres or Cassandra). For using the Admin API for Kong
          in DB-less mode, please refer to the
          <a href="/{{page.kong_version}}/db-less-admin-api">Admin API for DB-less Mode</a>
          page.
        </div>

        Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
        Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
        keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

        - `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
        - `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

        This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
        care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
        exposure of this API. See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
        of methods to secure the Admin API.

      text = [[
        The Admin API accepts 2 content types on every endpoint:

        - **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**

        Simple enough for basic request bodies, you will probably use it most of the time.
        Note that when sending nested values, Kong expects nested objects to be referenced
        with dotted keys. Example:

        ```
        config.limit=10&config.period=seconds
        ```

        - **application/json**

        Handy for complex bodies (ex: complex plugin configuration), in that case simply send
        a JSON representation of the data you want to send. Example:

        ```json
        {
            "config": {
                "limit": 10,
                "period": "seconds"

                  usage information, as reported by `collectgarbage("count")`, for every
                  active worker, i.e. a worker that received a proxy call in the last 10
                  seconds.
                * `pid`: worker's process identification number.
                * `lua_shared_dicts`: An array of information about dictionaries that are
                  shared with all workers in a Kong node, where each array node contains how
                  much memory is dedicated for the specific shared dictionary (`capacity`)
                  and how much of said memory is in use (`allocated_slabs`).
                  These shared dictionaries have least recent used (LRU) eviction
                  capabilities, so a full dictionary, where `allocated_slabs == capacity`,
                  will work properly. However for some dictionaries, e.g. cache HIT/MISS
                  shared dictionaries, increasing their size can be beneficial for the
                  overall performance of a Kong node.
              * The memory usage unit and precision can be changed using the querystring
                arguments `unit` and `scale`:
                  * `unit`: one of `b/B`, `k/K`, `m/M`, `g/G`, which will return results
                    in bytes, kibibytes, mebibytes, or gibibytes, respectively. When
                    "bytes" are requested, the memory values in the response will have a
                    number type instead of string. Defaults to `m`.
                  * `scale`: the number of digits to the right of the decimal points when
                    values are given in human-readable memory strings (unit other than
                    "bytes"). Defaults to `2`.
                  You can get the shared dictionaries memory usage in kibibytes with 4
                  digits of precision by doing: `GET /status?unit=k&scale=4`
            * `server`: Metrics about the nginx HTTP/S server.
                * `total_requests`: The total number of client requests.
                * `connections_active`: The current number of active client
                  connections including Waiting connections.
                * `connections_accepted`: The total number of accepted client
                  connections.
                * `connections_handled`: The total number of handled connections.
                  Generally, the parameter value is the same as accepts unless
                  some resource limits have been reached.
                * `connections_reading`: The current number of connections
                  where Kong is reading the request header.
                * `connections_writing`: The current number of connections
                  where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
                * `connections_waiting`: The current number of idle client
                  connections waiting for a request.
            * `database`: Metrics about the database.
                * `reachable`: A boolean value reflecting the state of the
                  database connection. Please note that this flag **does not**
                  reflect the health of the database itself.

        Tags are strings associated to entities in Kong. Each tag must be composed of one or more
        alphanumeric characters, `_`, `-`, `.` or `~`.

        Most core entities can be *tagged* via their `tags` attribute, upon creation or edition.

        Tags can be used to filter core entities as well, via the `?tags` querystring parameter.

        For example: if you normally get a list of all the Services by doing:

        ```
        GET /services
        ```

        You can get the list of all the Services tagged `example` by doing:

        ```
        GET /services?tags=example
        ```

        Similarly, if you want to filter Services so that you only get the ones tagged `example` *and*
        `admin`, you can do that like so:

        ```
        GET /services?tags=example,admin
        ```

        Finally, if you wanted to filter the Services tagged `example` *or* `admin`, you could use:

        ```
        GET /services?tags=example/admin
        ```

        Some notes:

        * A maximum of 5 tags can be queried simultaneously in a single request with `,` or `/`
        * Mixing operators is not supported: if you try to mix `,` with `/` in the same querystring,
          you will receive an error.
        * You may need to quote and/or escape some characters when using them from the
          command line.
        * Filtering by `tags` is not supported in foreign key relationship endpoints. For example,
          the `tags` parameter will be ignored in a request such as `GET /services/foo/routes?tags=a,b`
        * `offset` parameters are not guaranteed to work if the `tags` parameter is altered or removed

            will appear more than once in the resulting list. Similarly, if several entities
            have been tagged with the same tag, the tag will appear in several items of this list.

        to), which can be set as a single string or by specifying its `protocol`,
        `host`, `port` and `path` individually.

        Services are associated to Routes (a Service can have many Routes associated
        with it). Routes are entry-points in Kong and define rules to match client
        requests. Once a Route is matched, Kong proxies the request to its associated
        Service. See the [Proxy Reference][proxy-reference] for a detailed explanation
        of how Kong proxies traffic.

      details = [[
        See the [Precedence](#precedence) section below for more details.

        #### Precedence

        A plugin will always be run once and only once per request. But the
        configuration with which it will run depends on the entities it has been
        configured for.

        Plugins can be configured for various entities, combination of entities, or
        even globally. This is useful, for example, when you wish to configure a plugin
        a certain way for most requests, but make _authenticated requests_ behave
        slightly differently.

        Therefore, there exists an order of precedence for running a plugin when it has
        been applied to different entities with different configurations. The rule of
        thumb is: the more specific a plugin is with regards to how many entities it
        has been configured on, the higher its priority.

        The complete order of precedence when a plugin has been configured multiple
        times is:

        1. Plugins configured on a combination of: a Route, a Service, and a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        2. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        3. Plugins configured on a combination of a Service and a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        4. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Service.
        5. Plugins configured on a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        6. Plugins configured on a Route.
        7. Plugins configured on a Service.
        8. Plugins configured to run globally.

        **Example**: if the `rate-limiting` plugin is applied twice (with different
        configurations): for a Service (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin
        config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B
        and ignore A. However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer will
        fallback to running Plugin config A. Note that if config B is disabled
        (its `enabled` flag is set to `false`), config A will apply to requests that
        would have otherwise matched config B.

            this call tells Kong to start skipping this target in the ring-balancer
            algorithm.

            This call resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all
            workers of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the
            "unhealthy" status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.

            [Active health checks][active] continue to execute for unhealthy
            targets. Note that if active health checks are enabled and the probe detects
            that the target is actually healthy, it will automatically re-enable it again.
            To permanently remove a target from the ring-balancer, you should [delete a
            target](#delete-target) instead.

            This page refers to the Admin API for running Kong configured without a

            For using the Admin API for Kong with a database, please refer to the
            <a href="/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api">Admin API for Database Mode</a> page.
          </div>

          Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
          In [DB-less mode][db-less], this Admin API can be used to load a new declarative
          configuration, and for inspecting the current configuration. In DB-less mode,
          the Admin API for each Kong node functions independently, reflecting the memory state
          of that particular Kong node. This is the case because there is no database
          coordination between Kong nodes.

          - `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
          - `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

          This API provides full control over Kong, so care should be taken when setting
          up Kong environments to avoid undue public exposure of this API.
          See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
          of methods to secure the Admin API.
