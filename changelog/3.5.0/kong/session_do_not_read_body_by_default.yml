  **Session**: a new configuration field `read_body_for_logout` was added with a default value of `false`,
  that changes behavior of `logout_post_arg` in a way that it is not anymore considered if the
  `read_body_for_logout` is not explicitly set to `true`. This is to avoid session plugin from reading
  request bodies by default on e.g. `POST` request for logout detection.
