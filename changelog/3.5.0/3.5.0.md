## Kong


### Performance
#### Configuration

- Bumped the default value of `upstream_keepalive_pool_size` to `512` and `upstream_keepalive_max_requests` to `1000`
 [#11515](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/11515)

#### Core

- refactor workspace id and name retrieval
 [#11442](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/11442)


### Breaking Changes
#### Plugin

- **Session**: a new configuration field `read_body_for_logout` was added with a default value of `false`, that changes behavior of `logout_post_arg` in a way that it is not anymore considered if the `read_body_for_logout` is not explicitly set to `true`. This is to avoid session plugin from reading request bodies by default on e.g. `POST` request for logout detection.
