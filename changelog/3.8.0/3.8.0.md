### Features
#### Plugins

- **prometheus**: Added `ai_requests_total`, `ai_cost_total` and `ai_tokens_total` metrics in the Prometheus plugin to start counting AI usage.
 [#13148](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/13148)

#### Configuration

- You can now configure the Wasmtime module cache when Wasm is enabled.
 [#12930](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12930)
 [KAG-4372](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4372)
#### Core

- Added the new configuration parameter `concurrency_limit` (integer, defaults to 1), which lets you specify the number of delivery timers in the queue.
Note that setting `concurrency_limit` to `-1` means no limit at all, and each HTTP log entry would create an individual timer for sending.
 [#13332](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/13332)
 [FTI-6022](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/FTI-6022)

- Kong Gateway now appends gateway info to the upstream `Via` header in the format `1.1 kong/3.8.0`, and optionally to the
response `Via` header if it is present in the `headers` config of `kong.conf`, in the format `2 kong/3.8.0`.
This follows standards defined in RFC7230 and RFC9110.
 [#12733](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12733)
 [FTI-5807](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/FTI-5807)

- Starting from this version, a new DNS client library has been implemented and added into Kong. This library is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the `new_dns_client` parameter to `on`.
The new DNS client library provides the following:

 - Global caching for DNS records across workers, significantly reducing the query load on DNS servers.

 - Observable statistics for the new DNS client, and a new Status API `/status/dns` to retrieve them.

 - Simplified and standardized logic.
 [#12305](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12305)
 [KAG-3220](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3220)
#### PDK

- Added `0` to support unlimited body size. When parameter `max_allowed_file_size` is `0`, `get_raw_body` will return the entire body, but the size of this body will still be limited by Nginx's `client_max_body_size`.
 [#13431](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/13431)
 [KAG-4698](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4698)

- Extended `kong.request.get_body` and `kong.request.get_raw_body` to read from buffered files.
 [#13158](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/13158)


- Added a new PDK module `kong.telemetry` and the function `kong.telemetry.log`
to generate log entries to be reported via the OpenTelemetry plugin.
 [#13329](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/13329)
 [KAG-4848](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4848)
#### Plugin

 [KAG-4599](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4599)

- **AWS-Lambda**: Added the configuration field `empty_arrays_mode` to control whether Kong should send `[]` empty arrays (returned by Lambda function) as `[]` empty arrays or `{}` empty objects in JSON responses.

 [FTI-6145](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/FTI-6145)
#### Default

- **AI-proxy**: Added a configuration validation to prevent `log_statistics` from being enabled upon providers not supporting statistics.
