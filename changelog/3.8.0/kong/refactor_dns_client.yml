  Starting from this version, a new DNS client library has been implemented and added into Kong.
  This library is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the `new_dns_client` parameter to `on`.

  The new DNS client library provides the following:

   - Global caching for DNS records across workers, significantly reducing the query load on DNS servers.

   - Observable statistics for the new DNS client, and a new Status API `/status/dns` to retrieve them.

   - Simplified and standardized logic.
