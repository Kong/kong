message: |
  Kong Gateway now appends gateway info to the upstream `Via` header in the format `1.1 kong/3.8.0`, and optionally to the
  response `Via` header if it is present in the `headers` config of `kong.conf`, in the format `2 kong/3.8.0`.
  This follows standards defined in RFC7230 and RFC9110.
