message: Bumped default values of `nginx_http_keepalive_requests` and `upstream_keepalive_max_requests` to `10000`. These changes are optimized to work better in systems with high throughput. In a low-throughput setting, these new settings may have visible effects in loadbalancing - it can take more requests to start using all the upstreams than before.
