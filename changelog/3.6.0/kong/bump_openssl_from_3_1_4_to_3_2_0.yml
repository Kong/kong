  In OpenSSL 3.2, the default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2.
  Which means security level set to 112 bits of security. As a result
  RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 2048 bits and ECC keys shorter than
  224 bits are prohibited. In addition to the level 1 exclusions any cipher
  suite using RC4 is also prohibited. SSL version 3 is also not allowed.
