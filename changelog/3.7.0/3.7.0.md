### Features
#### Configuration

- now TLSv1.1 and lower is by default disabled in OpenSSL 3.x
 [#12420](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12420)
 [KAG-3259](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3259)

- Introduce `nginx_wasm_main_shm_kv` configuration entry, which enables
Wasm filters to use the Proxy-Wasm operations `get_shared_data` and
`set_shared_data` without namespaced keys.
 [#12663](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12663)


- **Schema**: Added a deprecation field attribute to identify deprecated fields
 [#12686](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12686)
 [KAG-3915](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3915)

- Add `wasm_filters` configuration value for enabling individual filters
 [#12843](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12843)
 [KAG-4211](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4211)
#### Core

- Add `events:ai:response_tokens`, `events:ai:prompt_tokens` and `events:ai:requests` to the anonymous report to start counting AI usage
 [#12924](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12924)


- When CP runs with `expressions` flavor:
- if mixed config is detected and a lower DP is attached to the CP, no config will be sent at all
- if the expression is invalid on CP, no config will be sent at all
- if the expression is invalid on lower DP, it will be sent to the DP and DP validation will catch this and communicate back to the CP (this could result in partial config application)
 [#12967](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12967)
 [KAG-3806](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3806)

- Supported fields `methods`, `hosts`, `paths`, `headers`,
`snis`, `sources`, `destinations` and `regex_priority`
for the `route` entity when the `router_flavor` is `expressions`.
The meaning of these fields are consistent with the traditional route entity.
 [#12667](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12667)
 [KAG-3805](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3805) [KAG-3807](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3807)

 [KAG-3798](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3798)
#### Plugin

- AI Proxy now reads most prompt tuning parameters from the client, whilst the
plugin config 'model options' are now just defaults. This fixes support for 
using the respective provider's native SDK.
 [#12903](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12903)
 [KAG-4126](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4126)

- AI Proxy now has a 'preserve' route_type option, where the requests and responses 
are passed directly to the upstream LLM. This is to enable compatilibity with any  
and all models and SDKs, that may be used when calling the AI services.
 [#12903](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12903)
 [KAG-4126](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4126)

 [KAG-623](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-623) [KAG-3751](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3751)

 [KAG-3759](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3759) [KAG-4124](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4124)
#### PDK

- **PDK:** fix kong.request.get_forwarded_port to always return a number which was caused by an incorrectly
stored string value in ngx.ctx.host_port.
 [#12806](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12806)
 [KAG-4158](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-4158)

- The value of `latencies.kong` in the log serializer payload no longer includes
the response receive time, so it now has the same value as the
`X-Kong-Proxy-Latency` response header. Response receive time is recorded in
the new `latencies.receive` metric, so if desired, the old value can be
calculated as `latencies.kong + latencies.receive`. **Note:** this also
affects payloads from all logging plugins that use the log serializer:
`file-log`, `tcp-log`, `udp-log`,`http-log`, `syslog`, and `loggly`.
 [#12795](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12795)

 [KAG-3699](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3699)
#### Default

- Fix a bug where the ulimit setting (open files) is low Kong will fail to start as the lua-resty-timer-ng exhausts the available worker_connections. Decrease the concurrency range of the lua-resty-timer-ng library from [512, 2048] to [256, 1024] to fix this bug.
 [#12606](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/12606)
 [KAG-3779](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/KAG-3779) [FTI-5780](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/FTI-5780)
