  When CP runs with `expressions` flavor:
  - if mixed config is detected and a lower DP is attached to the CP, no config will be sent at all
  - if the expression is invalid on CP, no config will be sent at all
  - if the expression is invalid on lower DP, it will be sent to the DP and DP validation will catch this and communicate back to the CP (this could result in partial config application)
