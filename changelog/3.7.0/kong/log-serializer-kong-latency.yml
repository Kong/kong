message: |
  The value of `latencies.kong` in the log serializer payload no longer includes
  the response receive time, so it now has the same value as the
  `X-Kong-Proxy-Latency` response header. Response receive time is recorded in
  the new `latencies.receive` metric, so if desired, the old value can be
  calculated as `latencies.kong + latencies.receive`. **Note:** this also
  affects payloads from all logging plugins that use the log serializer:
  `file-log`, `tcp-log`, `udp-log`,`http-log`, `syslog`, and `loggly`, e.g.
