   **kong.service.request.clear_query_arg**: Changed the encoding of spaces in query arguments from `+`
   to `%20` as a short-term solution to an issue that some users are reporting. While the `+` is correct
   encoding of space in querystrings, Kong uses `%20` in many other APIs (inherited from Nginx / OpenResty)
