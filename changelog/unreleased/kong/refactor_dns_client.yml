  Refactor and implement a new DNS client library
  1. Utilize mlcache as the DNS record cache
  2. Introduce observable statistics and admin API `/dns` to retrieve them
  3. Introduce the `legacy_dns_client` option to toggle whether to use the new library
  4. Deprecate the `dns_no_sync` option; it always uses synchronous queries
