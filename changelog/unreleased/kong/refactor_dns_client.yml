  Starting from this version, a new DNS client library has been implemented and added into Kong. The new DNS client library has the following changes
  - Introduced global caching for DNS records across workers, significantly reducing the query load on DNS servers.
  - Introduced observable statistics for the new DNS client, and a new Admin API `/status/dns` to retrieve them.
  - Deprecated the `dns_no_sync` option. Multiple DNS queries for the same name will always be synchronized (even across workers). This remains functional with the legacy DNS client library.
  - Deprecated the `dns_not_found_ttl` option. It uses the `dns_error_ttl` option for all error responses. This option remains functional with the legacy DNS client library.
  - Deprecated the `dns_order` option. By default, SRV, A, and AAAA are supported. Only names in the SRV format (`_service._proto.name`) enable resolving of DNS SRV records.
