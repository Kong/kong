  Starting from this version, a new DNS client library has been implemented and added into Kong. The new DNS client library has the following changes
  - Introduced global caching for DNS records across workers, significantly reducing the query load on DNS servers.
  - Introduced observable statistics for the new DNS client, and a new Admin API `/status/dns` to retrieve them.
  - Deprecated the `dns_no_sync` option in the context of the new DNS client library. With the new library, multiple DNS queries for the same name will always be synchronized (even across workers). The `dns_no_sync` option remains functional with the legacy DNS client library.
