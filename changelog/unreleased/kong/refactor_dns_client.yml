  Starting from this version, a new DNS client library has been implemented and added into Kong. The new DNS client library has the following changes
  - The new library now leverages `lua-resty-mlcache` for DNS record caching.
  - Introduced observable statistics for the new DNS client, and a new Admin API `/dns` to retrieve them.
  - Introduced a new option `legacy_dns_client` to toggle whether to use the new DNS client library.
  - Deprecated the `dns_no_sync` option in the context of the new DNS client library. With the new library, DNS queries will always be executed synchronously. The `dns_no_sync` option remains functional with the legacy DNS client library.
