  **AI-proxy**: A configuration validation is added to prevent from enabling `log_statistics` upon
  providers not supporting statistics. Accordingly, the default of `log_statistics` is changed from
  `true` to `false`, and a database migration is added as well for disabling `log_statistics` if it
  has already been enabled upon unsupported providers.
