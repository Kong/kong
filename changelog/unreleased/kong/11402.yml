  Fix several issues in Vault and refactor the Vault code base: - Make DAOs to fallback to empty string when resolving Vault references fail - Use node level mutex when rotation references  - Refresh references on config changes - Update plugin referenced values only once per request - Pass only the valid config options to vault implementations - Resolve multi-value secrets only once when rotating them - Do not start vault secrets rotation timer on control planes - Re-enable negative caching - Reimplement the kong.vault.try function - Remove references from rotation in case their configuration has changed
