# NGINX injected directives
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Nginx directives can be dynamically injected in the runtime nginx.conf file
# without requiring a custom Nginx configuration template.
#
# All configuration properties following the naming scheme
# `nginx_<namespace>_<directive>` will result in `<directive>` being injected in
# the Nginx configuration block corresponding to the property's `<namespace>`.
# Example:
#   `nginx_proxy_large_client_header_buffers = 8 24k`
#
#   Will inject the following directive in Kong's proxy `server {}` block:
#
#   `large_client_header_buffers 8 24k;`
#
# The following namespaces are supported:
#
# - `nginx_main_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's configuration
#   `main` context.
# - `nginx_events_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's `events {}`
#   block.
# - `nginx_http_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's `http {}` block.
# - `nginx_proxy_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's proxy
#   `server {}` block.
# - `nginx_location_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's proxy `/`
#   location block (nested under Kong's proxy `server {}` block).
# - `nginx_upstream_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's proxy
#   `upstream {}` block.
# - `nginx_admin_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's Admin API
#   `server {}` block.
# - `nginx_status_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's Status API
#   `server {}` block (only effective if `status_listen` is enabled).
# - `nginx_debug_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's Debug API
#   `server{}` block (only effective if `debug_listen` or `debug_listen_local`
#   is enabled).
# - `nginx_stream_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's stream module
#   `stream {}` block (only effective if `stream_listen` is enabled).
# - `nginx_sproxy_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's stream module
#   `server {}` block (only effective if `stream_listen` is enabled).
# - `nginx_supstream_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's stream

#
# As with other configuration properties, Nginx directives can be injected via
# environment variables when capitalized and prefixed with `KONG_`.
# Example:
#   `KONG_NGINX_HTTP_SSL_PROTOCOLS` -> `nginx_http_ssl_protocols`
#
#   Will inject the following directive in Kong's `http {}` block:
#
#   `ssl_protocols <value>;`
#
#   If different sets of protocols are desired between the proxy and Admin API
#   server, you may specify `nginx_proxy_ssl_protocols` and/or
#   `nginx_admin_ssl_protocols`, both of which take precedence over the
#   `http {}` block.

# DATASTORE
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Kong can run with a database to store coordinated data between Kong nodes in
# a cluster, or without a database, where each node stores its information
# independently in memory.
#
# When using a database, Kong will store data for all its entities (such as
# routes, services, consumers, and plugins) in PostgreSQL,
# and all Kong nodes belonging to the same cluster must connect to the same database.
#
# Kong supports PostgreSQL versions 9.5 and above.
#
# When not using a database, Kong is said to be in "DB-less mode": it will keep
# its entities in memory, and each node needs to have this data entered via a
# declarative configuration file, which can be specified through the
# `declarative_config` property, or via the Admin API using the `/config`
# endpoint.
#
# When using Postgres as the backend storage, you can optionally enable Kong
# to serve read queries from a separate database instance.
# When the number of proxies is large, this can greatly reduce the load
# on the main Postgres instance and achieve better scalability. It may also
# reduce the latency jitter if the Kong proxy node's latency to the main
# Postgres instance is high.
#
# The read-only Postgres instance only serves read queries, and write
# queries still go to the main connection. The read-only Postgres instance
# can be eventually consistent while replicating changes from the main
# instance.
#
# At least the `pg_ro_host` config is needed to enable this feature.
# By default, all other database config for the read-only connection is
# inherited from the corresponding main connection config described above but
# may be optionally overwritten explicitly using the `pg_ro_*` config below.

# DNS RESOLVER
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# By default, the DNS resolver will use the standard configuration files
# `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`. The settings in the latter file will be
# overridden by the environment variables `LOCALDOMAIN` and `RES_OPTIONS` if
# they have been set.
#
# Kong will resolve hostnames as either `SRV` or `A` records (in that order, and
# `CNAME` records will be dereferenced in the process).
# In case a name is resolved as an `SRV` record, it will also override any given
# port number with the `port` field contents received from the DNS server.
#
# The DNS options `SEARCH` and `NDOTS` (from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file) will
# be used to expand short names to fully qualified ones. So it will first try
# the entire `SEARCH` list for the `SRV` type, if that fails it will try the
# `SEARCH` list for `A`, etc.
#
# For the duration of the `ttl`, the internal DNS resolver will load balance each
# request it gets over the entries in the DNS record. For `SRV` records, the
# `weight` fields will be honored, but it will only use the lowest `priority`
# field entries in the record.

# A secret is any sensitive piece of information required for API gateway

# used in plugins, or part of the configuration associated with APIs serviced
# by the gateway.
#
# Some of the most common types of secrets used by Kong Gateway include:
#
# - Data store usernames and passwords, used with PostgreSQL and Redis
# - Private X.509 certificates
# - API keys
#
# Sensitive plugin configuration fields are generally used for authentication,
# hashing, signing, or encryption. Kong Gateway lets you store certain values

# WASM injected directives
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Nginx Wasm module (i.e., ngx_wasm_module) has its own settings, which can
# be tuned via `wasm_*` directives in the Nginx configuration file. Kong
# supports configuration of these directives via its Nginx directive injection
# mechanism.
#
# The following namespaces are supported:
#
# - `nginx_wasm_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` into the `wasm {}` block.
# - `nginx_wasm_shm_kv`: Injects `shm_kv *` into the `wasm {}` block,
#   allowing operators to define a general memory zone which is usable by
#   the `get_shared_data`/`set_shared_data` Proxy-Wasm SDK functions as
#   an in-memory key-value store of data shareable across filters.
# - `nginx_wasm_shm_kv_<name>`: Injects `shm_kv <name>` into the `wasm {}` block,
#   allowing operators to define custom shared memory zones which are usable by
#   the `get_shared_data`/`set_shared_data` Proxy-Wasm SDK functions as
#   separate namespaces in the `"<name>/<key>"` format.
#   For using these functions with non-namespaced keys, the Nginx template needs
#   a `shm_kv *` entry, which can be defined using `nginx_wasm_shm_kv`.
# - `nginx_wasm_wasmtime_<flag>`: Injects `flag <flag>` into the `wasmtime {}`
#   block, allowing various Wasmtime-specific flags to be set.
# - `nginx_<http|proxy>_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` into the
#   `http {}` or `server {}` blocks, as specified in the Nginx injected directives
#   section.
#
# The documentation for all supported directives can be found in the Nginx Wasm
# module repository:
#
# https://github.com/Kong/ngx_wasm_module/blob/main/docs/DIRECTIVES.md
#
# The Wasmtime flag documentation can be found here:
#
# https://docs.wasmtime.dev/c-api/config_8h.html
#
# There are several noteworthy ngx_wasm_module behaviors which can be tuned via
# `http {}`/`server {}` level directive injection (identical behavior in either
# level), for example:
#
# - `nginx_http_proxy_wasm_socket_<connect|read|send>_timeout`: sets connection/read/send
#   timeouts for Wasm dispatches.
# - `nginx_http_proxy_wasm_socket_buffer_size`: sets a buffer size for
#   reading Wasm dispatch responses.
#
# The values for these settings are inherited from their `nginx_*_lua_*`
# counterparts if they have not been explicitly set. For instance, if you set
# `nginx_http_lua_socket_connect_timeout`, the value
# of this setting will be propagated to `nginx_http_wasm_socket_connect_timeout`
# unless you _also_ set `nginx_http_wasm_socket_connect_timeout`.
#
# Some TLS-related settings receive special treatment as well:
#
# - `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate`: when set, the value is propagated to the
#   `nginx_wasm_tls_trusted_certificate` directive.
# - `lua_ssl_verify_depth`: when set (to a value greater than zero), several
#   TLS-related `nginx_wasm_*` settings are enabled:
#   - `nginx_wasm_tls_verify_cert`
#   - `nginx_wasm_tls_verify_host`
#   - `nginx_wasm_tls_no_verify_warn`
#
# Like other `kong.conf` fields, all injected Nginx directives documented here
# can be set via environment variable. For instance, setting:
#
#   `KONG_NGINX_WASM_TLS_VERIFY_CERT=<value>`
#
#   Will inject the following into the `wasm {}` block:
#
#   `tls_verify_cert <value>;`
#
# There are several Nginx directives supported by ngx_wasm_module which should
# not be used because they are irrelevant to or unsupported by Kong, or they may
# conflict with Kong's own management of Proxy-Wasm. Use of these directives may
# result in unintentional breakage:
#
# - `wasm_call`
# - `module`
# - `proxy_wasm`
# - `resolver_add`
# - `proxy_wasm_request_headers_in_access`
# - `shm_queue`

# REQUEST DEBUGGING
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Request debugging is a mechanism that allows admins to collect the timing of
# proxy path requests in the response header (X-Kong-Request-Debug-Output)
# and optionally, the error log.
#
# This feature provides insights into the time spent within various components of Kong,
# such as plugins, DNS resolution, load balancing, and more. It also provides contextual
# information such as domain names tried during these processes.
#

                                 # if the following headers are present in the proxy request:
                                 # - `X-Kong-Request-Debug`:
                                 #   If the value is set to `*`,
                                 #   timing information will be collected and exported for the current request.
                                 #   If this header is not present or contains an unknown value,
                                 #   timing information will not be collected for the current request.
                                 #   You can also specify a list of filters, separated by commas,
                                 #   to filter the scope of the time information that is collected.
                                 # The following filters are supported for `X-Kong-Request-Debug`:
                                 # - `rewrite`: Collect timing information from the `rewrite` phase.
                                 # - `access`: Collect timing information from the `access` phase.

                                 # - `header_filter`: Collect timing information from the `header_filter` phase.
                                 # - `body_filter`: Collect timing information from the `body_filter` phase.
                                 # - `log`: Collect timing information from the `log` phase.
                                 # - `upstream`: Collect timing information from the `upstream` phase.
