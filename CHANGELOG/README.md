# CHANGELOG

The CHANGELOG directory is used for individual changelog file practice.
The `kong/CHANGELOG.md` now is deprecated.


## How to add a changelog file for your PR?

1/ Copy the `changelog-template.yaml` file and rename with your PR number or a short message as the filename. For example, `11279.yaml`, `introduce-a-new-changelog-system.yaml`. (Prefer using PR number as it's already unique and wouldn't introduce conflict)

2/ Fill out the changelog template.


The description of the changelog file field, please follow the `schema.json` for more details.

- message: Message of the changelog
- type: Changelog type. (`feature`, `bugfix`, `dependency`, `deprecation`, `breaking_change`)
- scope: Changelog scope. (`Core`, `Plugin`, `PDK`, `Admin API`, `Performance`, `Configuration`, `Clustering`)
- prs: List of associated GitHub PRs
- issues: List of associated GitHub issues
- jiras: List of associated Jira tickets for internal track

Sample 1
```yaml
message: Introduce the request id as core feature.
type: feat
scope: Core
prs:
  - 11308
```

Sample 2
```yaml

type: bugfix
