## [0.7.0] - 2016/02/24

### Breaking changes

Due to the NGINX security fixes (CVE-2016-0742, CVE-2016-0746, CVE-2016-0747), OpenResty was bumped to `1.9.7.3` which is not backwards compatible, and thus requires changes to be made to the `nginx` property of Kong's configuration file. See the [0.7 upgrade path](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-07x) for instructions.

However by upgrading the underlying OpenResty version, source installations do not have to patch the NGINX core and use the old `ssl-cert-by-lua` branch of ngx_lua anymore. This will make source installations much easier.

### Added

- Support for OpenResty `1.9.7.*`. This includes NGINX security fixes (CVE-2016-0742, CVE-2016-0746, CVE-2016-0747). [#906](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/906)
- Plugins
  - **New Runscope plugin**: Monitor your APIs from Kong with Runscope. Courtesy of [@mansilladev](https://github.com/mansilladev). [#924](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/924)
  - Datadog: New `response.size` metric. [#923](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/923)
  - Rate-Limiting and Response Rate-Limiting
    - New `config.async` option to asynchronously increment counters to reduce latency at the cost of slighly reducing the accuracy. [#912](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/912)
    - New `config.continue_on_error` option to keep proxying requests in case the datastore is unreachable. rate-limiting operations will be disabled until the datastore is responsive again. [#953](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/953)
- CLI
  - Perform a simple permission check on the NGINX working directory when starting, to prevent errors during execution. [#939](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/939)
- Send 50x errors with the appropriate format. [#927](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/927) [#970](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/970)

### Fixed

- Plugins
  - OAuth2
    - Better handling of `redirect_uri` (prevent the use of fragments and correctly handle querystrings). Courtesy of [@PGBI](https://github.com/PGBI). [#930](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/930)
    - Add `PUT` support to the `/auth2_tokens` route. [#897](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/897)
    - Better error message when the `access_token` is missing. [#1003](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1003)
  - IP restriction: Fix an issue that could arise when restarting Kong. Now Kong does not need to be restarted for the ip-restriction configuration to take effect. [#782](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/782) [#960](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/960)
  - ACL: Properly invalidating entities when assigning a new ACL group. [#996](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/996)
  - SSL: Replace shelled out openssl calls with native `ngx.ssl` conversion utilities, which preserve the certificate chain. [#968](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/968)
- Avoid user warning on start when the user is not root. [#964](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/964)
- Store Serf logs in NGINX working directory to prevent eventual permission issues. [#975](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/975)
- Allow plugins configured on a Consumer *without* being configured on an API to run. [#978](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/978) [#980](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/980)
- Fixed an edge-case where Kong nodes would not be registered in the `nodes` table. [#1008](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1008)

## [0.6.1] - 2016/02/03

This release contains tiny bug fixes that were especially annoying for complex Cassandra setups and power users of the Admin API!

### Added

- A `timeout` property for the Cassandra configuration. In ms, this timeout is effective as a connection and a reading timeout. [#937](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/937)

### Fixed

- Correctly set the Cassandra SSL certificate in the Nginx configuration while starting Kong. [#921](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/921)
- Rename the `user` Cassandra property to `username` (Kong looks for `username`, hence `user` would fail). [#922](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/922)
- Allow Cassandra authentication with arbitrary plain text auth providers (such as Instaclustr uses), fixing authentication with them. [#937](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/937)
- Admin API
  - Fix the `/plugins/:id` route for `PATCH` method. [#941](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/941)
- Plugins
  - HTTP logging: remove the additional `\r\n` at the end of the logging request body. [#926](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/926)
  - Galileo: catch occasional internal errors happening when a request was cancelled by the client and fix missing shm for the retry policy. [#931](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/931)

## [0.6.0] - 2016/01/22

### Breaking changes

 We would recommended to consult the suggested [0.6 upgrade path](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-06x) for this release.

- [Serf](https://www.serfdom.io) is now a Kong dependency. It allows Kong nodes to communicate between each other opening the way to many features and improvements.
- The configuration file changed. Some properties were renamed, others were moved, and some are new. We would recommended checking out the new default configuration file.
- Drop the Lua 5.1 dependency which was only used by the CLI. The CLI now runs with LuaJIT, which is consistent with other Kong components (Luarocks and OpenResty) already relying on LuaJIT. Make sure the LuaJIT interpreter is included in your `$PATH`. [#799](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/799)

### Added

One of the biggest new features of this release is the cluster-awareness added to Kong in [#729](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/729), which deserves its own section:

- Each Kong node is now aware of belonging to a cluster through Serf. Nodes automatically join the specified cluster according to the configuration file's settings.
- The datastore cache is not invalidated by expiration time anymore, but following an invalidation strategy between the nodes of a same cluster, leading to improved performance.
- Admin API
  - Expose a `/cache` endpoint for retrieving elements stored in the in-memory cache of a node.
  - Expose a `/cluster` endpoint used to add/remove/list members of the cluster, and also used internally for data propagation.
- CLI
  - New `kong cluster` command for cluster management.
  - New `kong status` command for cluster healthcheck.

Other additions include:

- New Cassandra driver which makes Kong aware of the Cassandra cluster. Kong is now unaffected if one of your Cassandra nodes goes down as long as a replica is available on another node. Load balancing policies also improve the performance along with many other smaller improvements. [#803](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/803)
- Admin API
  - A new `total` field in API responses, that counts the total number of entities in the datastore. [#635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/635)
- Configuration
  - Possibility to configure the keyspace replication strategy for Cassandra. It will be taken into account by the migrations when the configured keyspace does not already exist. [#350](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/350)
  - Dnsmasq is now optional. You can specify a custom DNS resolver address that Kong will use when resolving hostnames. This can be configured in `kong.yml`. [#625](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/625)
- Plugins
  - **New "syslog" plugin**: send logs to local sytem log. [#698](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/698)
  - **New "loggly" plugin**: send logs to Loggly over UDP. [#698](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/698)
  - **New "datadog" plugin**: send logs to Datadog server. [#758](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/758)
  - OAuth2
    - Add support for `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. [#650](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/650)
    - Expose a new `/oauth2_tokens` endpoint with the possibility to retrieve, update or delete OAuth 2.0 access tokens. [#729](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/729)
  - JWT
    - Support for base64 encoded secrets. [#838](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/838) [#577](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/577)
    - Support to configure the claim in which the key is given into the token (not `iss` only anymore). [#838](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/838)
  - Request transformer
    - Support for more transformation options: `remove`, `replace`, `add`, `append` motivated by [#393](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/393). See [#824](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/824)
    - Support JSON body transformation. [#569](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/569)
  - Response transformer
    - Support for more transformation options: `remove`, `replace`, `add`, `append` motivated by [#393](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/393). See [#822](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/822)

### Changed

- As mentioned in the breaking changes section, a new configuration file format and validation. All properties are now documented and commented out with their default values. This allows for a lighter configuration file and more clarity as to what properties relate to. It also catches configuration mistakes. [#633](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/633)
- Replace the UUID generator library with a new implementation wrapping lib-uuid, fixing eventual conflicts happening in cases such as described in [#659](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/659). See [#695](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/695)
- Admin API
  - Increase the maximum body size to 10MB in order to handle configuration requests with heavy payloads. [#700](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/700)
  - Disable access logs for the `/status` endpoint.
  - The `/status` endpoint now includes `database` statistics, while the previous stats have been moved to a `server` response field. [#635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/635)

### Fixed

- Behaviors described in [#603](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/603) related to the failure of Cassandra nodes thanks to the new driver. [#803](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/803)
- Latency headers are now properly included in responses sent to the client. [#708](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/708)
- `strip_request_path` does not add a trailing slash to the API's `upstream_url` anymore before proxying. [#675](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/675)
- Do not URL decode querystring before proxying the request to the upstream service. [#749](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/749)
- Handle cases when the request would be terminated prior to the Kong execution (that is, before ngx_lua reaches the `access_by_lua` context) in cases such as the use of a custom nginx module. [#594](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/594)
- Admin API
  - The PUT method now correctly updates boolean fields (such as `strip_request_path`). [#765](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/765)
  - The PUT method now correctly resets a plugin configuration. [#720](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/720)
  - PATCH correctly set previously unset fields. [#861](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/861)
  - In the responses, the `next` link is not being displayed anymore if there are no more entities to be returned. [#635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/635)
  - Prevent the update of `created_at` fields. [#820](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/820)
  - Better `request_path` validation for APIs. "/" is not considered a valid path anymore. [#881](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/881)
- Plugins
  - Galileo: ensure the `mimeType` value is always a string in ALFs. [#584](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/584)
  - JWT: allow to update JWT credentials using the PATCH method. It previously used to reply with `405 Method not allowed` because the PATCH method was not implemented. [#667](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/667)
  - Rate limiting: fix a warning when many periods are configured. [#681](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/681)
  - Basic Authentication: do not re-hash the password field when updating a credential. [#726](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/726)
  - File log: better permissions for on file creation for file-log plugin. [#877](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/877)
  - OAuth2
    - Implement correct responses when the OAuth2 challenges are refused. [#737](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/737)
    - Handle querystring on `/authorize` and `/token` URLs. [#687](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/667)
    - Handle punctuation in scopes on `/authorize` and `/token` endpoints. [#658](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/658)

> ***internal***

> - The Kong Public Lua API (Lua helpers integrated in Kong such as DAO and Admin API helpers) is now documented with [ldoc](http://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/) format and published on [the online documentation](https://getkong.org/docs/latest/lua-reference/).
> - Work has been done to restore the reliability of the CI platforms.
> - Migrations can now execute DML queries (instead of DDL queries only). Handy for migrations implying plugin configuration changes, plugins renamings etc... [#770](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/770)

## [0.5.4] - 2015/12/03

## [0.5.0] - 2015/09/25

With new plugins, many improvements and bug fixes, this release comes with breaking changes that will require your attention.

### Breaking changes

Several breaking changes are introduced. You will have to slightly change your configuration file and a migration script will take care of updating your database cluster. **Please follow the instructions in [UPDATE.md](/UPDATE.md#update-to-kong-050) for an update without downtime**.

- Many plugins were renamed due to new naming conventions for consistency. [#480](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/480)
- In the configuration file, the Cassandra `hosts` property was renamed to `contact_points`. [#513](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/513)
- Properties belonging to APIs entities have been renamed for clarity. [#513](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/513)
  - `public_dns` -> `request_host`
  - `path` -> `request_path`
  - `strip_path` -> `strip_request_path`
  - `target_url` -> `upstream_url`
- `plugins_configurations` have been renamed to `plugins`, and their `value` property has been renamed to `config` to avoid confusions. [#513](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/513)
- The database schema has been updated to handle the separation of plugins outside of the core repository.
- The Key authentication and Basic authentication plugins routes have changed:

```
Old route                             New route
/consumers/:consumer/keyauth       -> /consumers/:consumer/key-auth
/consumers/:consumer/keyauth/:id   -> /consumers/:consumer/key-auth/:id
/consumers/:consumer/basicauth     -> /consumers/:consumer/basic-auth
/consumers/:consumer/basicauth/:id -> /consumers/:consumer/basic-auth/:id
```

The old routes are still maintained but will be removed in upcoming versions. Consider them **deprecated**.

- Admin API
  - The route to retrieve enabled plugins is now under `/plugins/enabled`.
  - The route to retrieve a plugin's configuration schema is now under `/plugins/schema/{plugin name}`.

#### Added

- Plugins
  - **New Response Rate Limiting plugin**: Give a usage quota to your users based on a parameter in your response. [#247](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/247)

  - **New HMAC signature plugin**: Verify and authenticate HMAC signed HTTP requests. [#549](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/549)
  - Plugins migrations. Each plugin can now have its own migration scripts if it needs to store data in your cluster. This is a step forward to improve Kong's pluggable architecture. [#443](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/443)
  - Basic Authentication: the password field is now sha1 encrypted. [#33](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/33)
  - Basic Authentication: now supports credentials in the `Proxy-Authorization` header. [#460](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/460)

#### Changed

- Basic Authentication and Key Authentication now require authentication parameters even when the `Expect: 100-continue` header is being sent. [#408](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/408)
- Key Auth plugin does not support passing the key in the request payload anymore. [#566](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/566)
- APIs' names cannot contain characters from the RFC 3986 reserved list. [#589](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/589)

#### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2015/05/12

This is a maintenance release including several bug fixes and usability improvements.

#### Added
- Support for local DNS resolution. [#194](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/194)
- Support for Debian 8 and Ubuntu 15.04.
- DAO
  - Cassandra version bumped to 2.1.5
  - Support for Cassandra downtime. If Cassandra goes down and is brought back up, Kong will not need to restart anymore, statements will be re-prepared on-the-fly. This is part of an ongoing effort from [jbochi/lua-resty-cassandra#47](https://github.com/jbochi/lua-resty-cassandra/pull/47), [#146](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/146) and [#187](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/187).
Queries effectued during the downtime will still be lost. [#11](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/11)
  - Leverage reused sockets. If the DAO reuses a socket, it will not re-set their keyspace. This should give a small but appreciable performance improvement. [#170](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/170)
  - Cascade delete plugins configurations when deleting a Consumer or an API associated with it. [#107](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/107)
  - Allow Cassandra hosts listening on different ports than the default. [#185](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/185)
- CLI
  - Added a notice log when Kong tries to connect to Cassandra to avoid user confusion. [#168](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/168)
  - The CLI now tests if the ports are already being used before starting and warns.
- Admin API
  - `name` is now an optional property for APIs. If none is being specified, the name will be the API `public_dns`. [#181](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/181)
- Configuration
  - The memory cache size is now configurable. [#208](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/208)

#### Fixed
- Resolver
  - More explicit "API not found" message from the resolver if the Host was not found in the system. "Api not foun with Host: %s".
  - If multiple hosts headers are being sent, Kong will test them all to see if one of the API is in the system. [#186](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/186)
- Admin API: responses now have a new line after the body. [#164](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/164)
- DAO: keepalive property is now properly passed when Kong calls `set_keepalive` on Cassandra sockets.
- Multipart dependency throwing error at startup. [#213](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/213)

> **internal**
> - Separate Migrations from the DAO factory.
> - Update dev config + Makefile rules (`run` becomes `start`).
> - Introducing an `ngx` stub for unit tests and CLI.
> - Switch many PCRE regexes to using patterns.

## [0.2.0-2] - 2015/04/27

First public release of Kong. This version brings a lot of internal improvements as well as more usability and a few additional plugins.

#### Added
- Plugins
  - CORS plugin.
  - Request transformation plugin.
  - NGINX plus monitoring plugin.
- Configuration
  - New properties: `proxy_port` and `api_admin_port`. [#142](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/142)
- CLI
  - Better info, help and error messages. [#118](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/118) [#124](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/124)
  - New commands: `kong reload`, `kong quit`. [#114](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/114) Alias of `version`: `kong --version` [#119](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/119)
  - `kong restart` simply starts Kong if not previously running + better pid file handling. [#131](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/131)
- Package distributions: .rpm, .deb and .pkg for easy installs on most common platforms.

#### Fixed
- Admin API: trailing slash is not necessary anymore for core ressources such as `/apis` or `/consumers`.
- Leaner default configuration. [#156](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/156)

> **internal**
> - All scripts moved to the CLI as "hidden" commands (`kong db`, `kong config`).
> - More tests as always, and they are structured better. The coverage went down mainly because of plugins which will later move to their own repos. We are all eagerly waiting for that!
> - `src/` was renamed to `kong/` for ease of development
> - All system dependencies versions for package building and travis-ci are now listed in `versions.sh`
> - DAO doesn't need to `:prepare()` prior to run queries. Queries can be prepared at runtime. [#146](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/146)

## [0.1.1beta-2] - 2015/03/30

#### Fixed

- Wrong behaviour of auto-migration in `kong start`.

## [0.1.0beta-3] - 2015/03/25

First public beta. Includes caching and better usability.

#### Added
- Required Openresty is now `1.7.10.1`.
- Freshly built CLI, rewritten in Lua
- `kong start` using a new DB keyspace will automatically migrate the schema. [#68](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/68)
- Anonymous error reporting on Proxy and API. [#64](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/64)
- Configuration
  - Simplified configuration file (unified in `kong.yml`).
  - In configuration, `plugins_installed` was renamed to `plugins_available`. [#59](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/59)
  - Order of `plugins_available` doesn't matter anymore. [#17](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/17)
  - Better handling of plugins: Kong now detects which plugins are configured and if they are installed on the current machine.
  - `bin/kong` now defaults on `/etc/kong.yml` for config and `/var/logs/kong` for output. [#71](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/71)
- Proxy: APIs/Consumers caching with expiration for faster authentication.
- Admin API: Plugins now use plain form parameters for configuration. [#70](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/70)
- Keep track of already executed migrations. `rollback` now behaves as expected. [#8](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/8)

#### Fixed
- `Server` header now sends Kong. [#57](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/57)
- migrations not being executed in order on Linux. This issue wasn't noticed until unit testing the migrations because for now we only have 1 migration file.
- Admin API: Errors responses are now sent as JSON. [#58](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/58)

> **internal**
> - We now have code linting and coverage.
> - Faker and Migrations instances don't live in the DAO Factory anymore, they are only used in scripts and tests.
> - `scripts/config.lua` allows environment based configurations. `make dev` generates a `kong.DEVELOPMENT.yml` and `kong_TEST.yml`. Different keyspaces and ports.
> - `spec_helpers.lua` allows tests to not rely on the `Makefile` anymore. Integration tests can run 100% from `busted`.
> - Switch integration testing from [httpbin.org] to [mockbin.com].
> - `core` plugin was renamed to `resolver`.
