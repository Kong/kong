*Note: New features are to be opened against `next`, hotfixes against `master`.
Please also note that we will no longer be accepting PRs for new plugin concepts
into Kong core at this time. Feel free to publish this plugin on your own
following the [distributing your plugin](https://getkong.org/docs/0.10.x/plugin-development/distribution/#distribute-your-plugin)
guide. You are also encouraged to advertise it on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/konglayer),
and we will soon provide a "community plugins" section on
[getkong.org/plugins/](http://getkong.org/plugins/) on which you will be able to
document it.*
