Hi ChatGPT, I have a pull request with title "$title" and the description is as follows,

The filename:

The patch:
```diff
$patch

Check the changelog message, if present, and verify that it adheres to the styleguide:

The styleguide:
  * The message is written in past-tense
  * The message is relatively short (less than 200 characters)
  * The message is structurally sound (starts with a verb, ends with a period)
  * The spelling is correct
  * When you are referring to the user, use “You” and “your” instead of “user” and “their”.
  * When you are writing a bug fix description that fixes something back to its original state, use the wording “Fixed an issue where…”
  * When you are writing a bug fix description that changes the functionality so its different than the original state, use wording that describes how it functions now, ex. “[feature] now does [explanation of new function]”
  * When you are writing breaking changes, explain what the change is and provide information about how a user can correct their environment.
  * When you are writing deprecations/removals, explain what is being removed/deprecated and a timeline for deprecation/removal.
  * The scope can only be one of:
    * Performance
		* Configuration
		* Core
		* PDK
		* Plugin
		* Admin
		* Clustering
		* Default
  * When you are writing a message for a change with "scope: Plugin" then ensure that it is prefixed with plugin name, ex. 'message: "**rate-limiting**: ..."'

Good examples would be:
  * Fixed a bug in the login page where ...
  * Added a new feature for the dashboard that..
  * Users can now use analytics to create graphs based on the latency of their services.
  * Fixed an issue where Kong Gateway failed to generate a keyring when RBAC was enabled.
  * Websocket requests now generate balancer spans when tracing is enabled.

Bad examples would be:
  * You can now use analytics to create graphs based on the latency of your services.
  * Kong Gateway failed to generate a keyring when RBAC was enabled.
  * Fixes Websocket tracing.
