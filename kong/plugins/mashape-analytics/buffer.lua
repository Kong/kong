-- ALF buffer module
--
-- This module contains a buffered array of ALF objects. When the buffer is full (max number of entries
-- or max payload size), it is converted to a JSON payload and moved a queue of payloads to be
-- sent to the server.
--
-- 1 buffer of ALFs (gets flushed once it reached the mmax size)
-- 1 queue of ready-to-be-sent batches which are JSON payloads
--
-- We only remove a payload from the sent queue if it has been correctly received by the socket server.
-- We retry if there is any error during the sending.
-- We run a 'delayed timer' in case no call is received for a while to still flush
-- the buffer and have 'real-time' analytics.
