local seed

--- Seeds the random generator, use with care.
-- Once - properly - seeded, this method is replaced with a stub
-- one. This is to enforce best-practises for seeding in ngx_lua,
-- and prevents third-party modules from overriding our correct seed
-- (many modules make a wrong usage of `math.randomseed()` by calling
-- it multiple times or do not use unique seed for Nginx workers).
--
-- This patched method will create a unique seed per worker process,
-- using a combination of both time and the worker's pid.

    -- if we'd do that in the 'init' phase, the Lua VM is not forked
    -- yet and all workers would end-up using the same seed.
