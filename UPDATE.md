This document describes eventual additional steps that might be required to update between two versions of Kong. If nothing is described here for a particular version and platform, then assume the update will go smoothly.

## Update to Kong `0.3.x`

Kong now requires a patch on OpenResty for SSL support. On Homebrew you will need to reinstall OpenResty.

#### Homebrew

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew reinstall mashape/kong/ngx_openresty
$ brew upgrade kong
```

#### Troubleshoot

If you are seeing a similar error on `kong start`:

```
nginx: [error] [lua] init_by_lua:5: Startup error: Cassandra error: Failed to prepare statement: "SELECT id FROM apis WHERE path = ?;". Cassandra returned error (Invalid): "Undefined name path in where clause ('path = ?')"
```

You can run the following command to update your schema:

```
$ kong migrations up
```

Please consider updating to `0.3.1` or greater which automatically handles the schema migration.
