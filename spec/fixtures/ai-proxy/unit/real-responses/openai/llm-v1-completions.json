      "text": "\n\nDividing by zero is undefined because it violates the fundamental mathematical principle of division, which states that when dividing a number by another number, the result is the number of times the divisor can fit into the dividend. In other words, division is the inverse operation of multiplication.\n\nHowever, when dividing by zero, there is no number that can be multiplied by zero to give a specific result. This is because any number multiplied by zero will always equal zero, therefore there is no solution or value that can be assigned to the quotient.\n\nAdditionally, dividing by zero can lead to contradictory or nonsensical results. For example, if we divide a number by a smaller and smaller number approaching zero, the resulting quotient becomes larger and larger, approaching infinity. On the other hand, if we divide a number by a larger and larger number approaching zero, the resulting quotient becomes smaller and smaller, approaching negative infinity. This inconsistency shows that dividing by zero does not follow the rules of arithmetic and is therefore considered undefined.\n\nIn summary, division by zero is not allowed because it is mathematically undefined and can lead to nonsensical results."
