        "content": "Dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics because it leads to results that are contradictory or nonsensical. \n\nHere's a simple way to think about it: Division is the inverse of multiplication. If you divide 10 by 2, you're asking \"what number times 2 gives me 10?\" The answer is 5, because 5 times 2 equals 10. \n\nBut if you ask \"what number times 0 gives me 10?\" there is no number that can fulfill this, because zero times any number always equals zero. \n\nTherefore, division by zero is undefined because there is no number that you can multiply by 0 to get a non-zero number.",
