Kong is a scalable, open-source Management Layer for APIs and Microservices. Built on top of NGINX with focus on high performance and reliability --> http://getkong.org/

## Why Kong

We used to write custom code for each service. With Kong we **write once, dispatch everywhere**.

## Installation

1. Download: [http://getkong.org/download](http://getkong.org/download)
2. Run `kong start`

**Note:** Kong requires [Cassandra 2.1.3](http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/2.1.3/)

## Documentation

Visit [getkong.org](http://getkong.org/docs/) for the official Kong documentation.

## Usage

Use Kong through the `kong` CLI:

```bash
$ kong --help
```

**Note** If you installed Kong via one of the [available methods](http://getkong.org/download/), then `kong` should already be in your `$PATH`.

## Development

1. Clone the repository and make it your working directory.
2. Run `[sudo] make install`

  This will build and install the `kong` luarock globally.

3. Run `make dev`

  This will install development dependencies and create your environment configuration files:

  - `kong_TESTS.yml`
  - `kong_DEVELOPMENT.yml`

4. Run the tests:

  ```bash
  make test-all
  ```

5. Run Kong with the development configuration file:

   ```bash
   $ kong start -c kong_DEVELOPMENT.yml
   ```

#### Makefile Operations

When developing, use the `Makefile` for doing the following operations:
