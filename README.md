**Kong** or **Kong API Gateway** is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins.

By providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and [more](#features)), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic with ease.

Kong runs natively on Kubernetes thanks to its official [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller).

## Getting Started

Let’s test drive Kong by adding authentication to an API in under 5 minutes.

We suggest using the docker-compose distribution via the instructions below, but there is also a [docker installation](https://docs.konghq.com/install/docker/) procedure if you’d prefer to run the Kong API Gateway in DB-less mode. 

Whether you’re running in the cloud, on bare metal or using containers, you can find every supported distribution on our [official installation](https://konghq.com/install/#kong-community) page.

1) To start, clone the Docker repository and navigate to the compose folder.
```cmd
  $ git clone https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong
  $ cd compose/
```

1) Start the Gateway stack using:
```cmd
  $ docker-compose up
```

The Gateway will be available on the following ports on localhost:

`:8000` on which Kong listens for incoming HTTP traffic from your clients, and forwards it to your upstream services.
`:8001` on which the Admin API used to configure Kong listens.

Next, follow the [quick start guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/getting-started/configuring-a-service/
) to tour the Gateway features.

## Features

By centralizing common API functionality across all your organization's services, the Kong API Gateway creates more freedom for engineering teams to focus on the challenges that matter most. 

The top Kong features include:
- Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via an admin API or declarative configuration.
- Authentication and Authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, ACLs and more.
- Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.
- Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.
- Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.
- Native ingress controller support for serving Kubernetes.
