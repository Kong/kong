######
## Kong configuration file. All commented values are default values.
## Uncomment and update a value to configure Kong to your needs.
##
## Lines starting with `##` are comments.
## Lines starting with `#` are properties that can be updated.
## Beware of YAML formatting for nested properties.

######
## Additional plugins that this node needs to load.
## If you want to load custom plugins that are not supported by Kong, uncomment and update
## this property with the names of the plugins to load.
## Plugins will be loaded from the kong.plugins.{name}.* namespace.
# custom_plugins:
  # - hello_world
  # - custom_plugin2
  # - ...

######
## The Kong working directory. Equivalent to nginx's prefix path.
## This is where this running nginx instance will keep server files including logs.
## Make sure it has the appropriate permissions.
# nginx_working_dir: /usr/local/kong/

######
## Address and port on which the server will accept HTTP requests, consumers will make requests on this port.
# proxy_listen: "0.0.0.0:8000"

######
## Same as proxy_listen, but for HTTPS requests.
# proxy_listen_ssl: "0.0.0.0:8443"

######
## Address and port on which the admin API will listen to. The admin API is a private API which lets you
## manage your Kong infrastructure. It needs to be secured appropriately.
# admin_api_listen: "0.0.0.0:8001"

######
## Address and port used by the node to communicate with other Kong nodes in the cluster with both UDP and
## TCP messages. All the nodes in the cluster must be able to communicate with this node on this address.
## Only IPv4 addresses are allowed (no hostnames).
# cluster_listen: "0.0.0.0:7946"

######
## Address and port used by the node to communicate with the local clustering agent (TCP only, and local only).
## Used internally by this Kong node. Only IPv4 addresses are allowed (no hostnames).
# cluster_listen_rpc: "127.0.0.1:7373"

######
## The path to the SSL certificate and key that Kong will use when listening on the `https` port.
# ssl_cert_path: /path/to/certificate.pem
# ssl_key_path: /path/to/certificate.key

######
## Specify how Kong performs DNS resolution (in the `dns_resolvers_available` property) you want to use.
## Options are: "dnsmasq" (You will need dnsmasq to be installed) or "server".
# dns_resolver: dnsmasq

######
## A dictionary of DNS resolvers Kong can use, and their respective properties.
## Currently `dnsmasq` (default, http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) and `server` are supported.
## By choosing `dnsmasq`, Kong will resolve hostnames using the local `/etc/hosts` file and `resolv.conf`
## configuration. By choosing `server`, you can specify a custom DNS server.
# dns_resolvers_available:
  # server:
    # address: "8.8.8.8:53"
  # dnsmasq:
    # port: 8053

######
## Cluster settings between Kong nodes.
## For more information take a look at the Clustering Reference: https://getkong.org/docs/latest/clustering/
# cluster:

  ######
  ## Address and port used by the node to communicate with other Kong nodes in the cluster with both UDP and
  ## TCP messages. All the nodes in the cluster must be able to communicate with this node on this address.
  ## Only IPv4 addresses are allowed (no hostnames).
  ## The advertise flag is used to change the address that we advertise to other nodes in the
  ## cluster. By default, the cluster_listen address is advertised. If the cluster_listen host is "0.0.0.0",
  ## then the first local, non-loopback, IPv4 address will be advertised to the other nodes. However, in some
  ## cases (specifically NAT traversal), there may be a routable address that cannot be bound to. This flag
  ## enables gossiping a different address to support this.
  # advertise: ""

  ######
  ## Key for encrypting network traffic within Kong. Must be a base64-encoded 16-byte key.
  # encrypt: "foo"

  ######
  ## The TTL (time to live), in seconds, of a node in the cluster when it stops sending healthcheck pings, maybe
  ## because of a failure. If the node is not able to send a new healthcheck before the expiration, then new nodes
  ## in the cluster will stop attempting to connect to it on startup. Should be at least 60.
  # ttl_on_failure: 3600

######
## Specify which database to use. Only "cassandra" and "postgres" are currently available.
# database: cassandra

######
## PostgreSQL configuration
# postgres:
  # host: "127.0.0.1"
  # port: 5432

  ######
  ## Name of the database used by Kong. Will be created if it does not exist.
  # database: kong

  #####
  ## User authentication settings
  # user: ""
  # password: ""

######
## Cassandra configuration (keyspace, authentication, client-to-node encryption)
# cassandra:
  ######
  ## Contact points to your Cassandra cluster.
  # contact_points:
  #   - "127.0.0.1:9042"

  ## Port on which your cluster's peers (other than your contact_points)
  ## are listening on.
  # port: 9042

  ######
  ## Name of the keyspace used by Kong. Will be created if it does not exist.
  # keyspace: kong

  #####
  ## Connection and reading timeout (in ms).
  # timeout: 5000

  ######
  ## Keyspace options. Set those before running Kong or any migration.
  ## Those settings will be used to create a keyspace with the desired options
  ## when first running the migrations.
  ## See http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/create_keyspace_r.html
  ######
  ## The name of the replica placement strategy class for the keyspace.
  ## Can be "SimpleStrategy" or "NetworkTopologyStrategy".
  # replication_strategy: SimpleStrategy
  ######
  ## For SimpleStrategy only.
  ## The number of replicas of data on multiple nodes.
  # replication_factor: 1
  ######
  ## For NetworkTopologyStrategy only.
  ## The number of replicas of data on multiple nodes in each data center.
  # data_centers:
  #   dc1: 2
  #   dc2: 3

  #####
  ## Consistency level to use.
  ## See http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_config_consistency_c.html
  # consistency: ONE

  #####
  ## Client-to-node TLS options.
  ## `enabled`: if true, will connect to your Cassandra instance using TLS.
  ## `verify`: if true, will verify the server certificate using the given CA file.
  ## `certificate_authority`: an absolute path to the trusted CA certificate in PEM format used to verify the server certificate.
  ## For additional SSL settings, see the ngx_lua `lua_ssl_*` directives.
  # ssl:
  #   enabled: false
  #   verify: false
  #   certificate_authority: "/path/to/cluster-ca-certificate.pem"

  ######
  ## Cluster authentication options. Provide a user and a password here if your cluster uses the
  ## PasswordAuthenticator scheme.
  # username: cassandra
  # password: cassandra

######
## Kong will send anonymous reports to Mashape. This helps Mashape fixing bugs/errors and improving Kong.
## By default is `true`.
# send_anonymous_reports: true

######
## A value specifying (in MB) the size of the internal preallocated in-memory cache. Kong uses an in-memory
## cache to store database entities in order to optimize access to the underlying datastore. The cache size
## needs to be as big as the size of the entities being used by Kong at any given time. The default value
## is `128`, and the potential maximum value is the total size of the datastore.
## This value may not be smaller than 32MB.
# memory_cache_size: 128

######
## The NGINX configuration (or `nginx.conf`) that will be used for this instance.
## The placeholders will be computed and this property will be written as a file
## by Kong at `<nginx_working_dir>/nginx.conf` during startup.
## This file can tweaked to some extent, but many directives are necessary for Kong to work.
