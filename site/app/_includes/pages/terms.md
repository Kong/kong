# Welcome to Kong

These Terms apply to individuals and entities that provide access to APIs via the Service (&quot;**API Providers**&quot;) and individuals and entities that obtain access to APIs via the Service (“**API Consumers**”). Unless otherwise specified, “you” refers to both API Providers and API Consumers.

The &quot;**Effective Date**&quot; of these Terms is the date you first access the Service.

**SERVICE &amp; REGISTRATION**

**Service**

Mashape’s API marketplace/network connects API Providers and API Consumers. The Service enables API Providers to list the APIs they offer for purchase by API Consumers. Each API offering includes a description of the API, its associated price, and other related terms and conditions. API Consumers may purchase the right to use an API on an individual basis or as part of a subscription plan.

Mashape grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, and limited license to access and use the Service subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms.

**Registration**

In order to access the Service, API Providers and API Consumers must register with Mashape by completing the registration forms provided via the Site. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current, and complete information as may be prompted by the registration forms via the Site (&quot;**Registration Data**&quot;), (b) maintain the security of your Mashape account password, (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to Mashape, to keep it accurate, current, and complete and (d) accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Registration Data and any other information you provide to Mashape.

You are responsible for safeguarding the passwords you use to access the Service and agree to be fully responsible for activities or transactions that relate to your Mashape account or password. You must notify Mashape immediately if you learn of an unauthorized use of your Mashape account or password.

**API Rights -- Between API Providers and API Consumers (not Mashape)**

Mashape provides the marketplace, but the terms and conditions applicable to the APIs (including, the use of the APIs) are between API Providers and API Consumers (not Mashape).

With respect to each API, API Consumers and the API Provider who listed such API via the Service acknowledge and agree that the terms and conditions applicable to the use of and other rights with respect to such API by each such API Consumer are solely between each such API Consumer and such API Provider, and not with Mashape. Each API Provider (not Mashape) is responsible for all support and all claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).

Mashape reserves the right, but does not have the obligation, to review, screen, or monitor any links to any APIs or any API Content/Terms (as defined below) at any time and for any reason without notice.  API Providers and API Consumers acknowledge and agree that Mashape may remove any API or any API Content/Terms at Mashape’s sole discretion.** **

**API Provider**

API Provider – Grants and Obligations

API Providers may APIs via the Service by completing Mashape’s listing form.

For each API, API Providers must provide the URLs applicable to such API on the API Provider’s websites (&quot;**API Provider Sites**&quot;), a brief description of the API, the API pricing parameters (free use, unique object pricing, or subscription), any overage fees and any other applicable terms and conditions (e.g., service level standards) (collectively, “**API Content/Terms**”).

API Provider grants Mashape the right to provide the APIs and the API Content/Terms provided by API Provider (or a party on its behalf) via the Service. Further, API Provider consents to Mashape’s use of its name and, if applicable, API Provider’s company’s name and logo on the Site and our publicly-available online and printed materials, identifying API Provider (and, if applicable, API Provider’s company) as part of the Mashape API network.

API Provider, not Mashape, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the API Content/Terms applicable to each API to which it grants an API Consumer access. API Provider acknowledges and agrees that Mashape will not be liable for any actual or alleged breach of the terms and conditions governing the use of APIs by API Consumer (or any damages arising from or related to such actual or alleged breach).

API Provider represents and warrants that (a) all representations and warranties made by API Provider with respect to the APIs it lists via the Service are true and accurate; and (b) it owns (or has full rights to) to market, promote, offer to sell, sell, grants access to, and distribute the APIs it lists via the Service and all API Content/Terms posted to the Service.

In the event Mashape provides API Consumer email addresses or other contract information to an API Provider, such API Provider may use such email addresses or other contact information solely to provide API Provider’s APIs to API Consumer in connection with the Service. In no event may API Provider bypass Mashape’s billing, management, marketplace or Service and/or use any information obtained via Mashape, the Service or the Site (including, but not limited to, any API Consumer email addresses or other contract information) for any purpose other than expressly authorized in these Terms. For example, API Provider may not use any API Consumer email addresses or other contract information to solicit API Consumers or other users to leave the Service or obtain APIs directly via API Providers or any non-Mashape source.

API Provider – Payments

Mashape collects subscription fees and other payments associated with API Consumers’ access and use of APIs provide by API Providers via the Service (&quot;**API Fees**&quot;). Following Mashape’s receipt of the API Fees applicable to an API listed on the Service by an API Provider, Mashape will passed on such amount to the applicable API Provider less a Mashape transaction fee. API Providers are paid on a monthly basis in arrears via the Service. Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, API Providers acknowledge and agree that Mashape will use reasonable effort to collect API Fees, but Mashape is not responsible for any failure to collect API Fees (including, but not limited to, any damages that arise out of, result from, are attributable to or are in any way incidental to such failure).

Mashape, at its sole discretion, may modify its transaction fee with no less than 7 days advance notice.

**API Consumer**

API Consumer – Subscription Packages

API Consumer may browse listed APIs and subscribe to access and use APIs pursuant to one of the Mashape API subscription plans selected by API Consumer. Depending on a particular API offering, API Consumer may also be able to arrange custom pricing and service directly with an API Provider.

Unless otherwise expressly set forth in the Mashape subscription plan selected by an API Consumer, Mashape subscription plans will automatically renew for additional periods equivalent in length to the initial Mashape subscription period selected by such API Consumer. Each API Consumer may change the type of Mashape subscription plan selected or terminate the Mashape subscription plan according to the terms and conditions of such subscription plan.

API Consumer – Fees

The pricing terms for each API Consumer’s access and use of APIs are set forth in the Mashape subscription plan selected by such API Consumer (unless the API is not being purchased pursuant to a Mashape subscription plan). All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars by credit or debit card via an authorized Mashape payment processor.

Mashape will charge the credit/debit card provided by API Consumer via the Service in advance and in accordance the subscription plan selected by API Consumer. Most plans are monthly with subscriptions payable at the beginning of each month.

Each API Consumer hereby authorizes Mashape (or its authorized payment processor) to charge the credit/debit card number provided via the Service by such API Consumer in accordance with the Mashape subscription plan selected, and such API Consumer represents and warrants that such API Consumer is authorized to use and have fees charged to the credit/debit card number provided to Mashape. API Consumer understands that it may withdraw such authorization by contacting Mashape at [support@mashape.com](mailto:support@mashape.com).

**ARBITRATION**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH MASHAPE AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MASHAPE.

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and Mashape agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, California. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Mashape are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Mashape intend and agree: (a) not to assert class action or representative action procedures and agree that they will not apply in any arbitration involving the other; (b) not to assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise; and (c) will only submit individual claims in arbitration and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person or entity.

If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in San Francisco, California. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys&#39; fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.

**MISCELLANEOUS**

Independent Contractors

Neither party will, for any purpose, be deemed to be an agent, franchisor, franchise, employee, representative, owner, or partner of the other party, and the relationship between the parties will only be that of independent contractors. Neither party will have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.

Assignment

You may not assign, delegate, or transfer (by sale, merger, operation of law, or otherwise) these Terms or any right, title, interest, or obligation hereunder without the prior written consent of Mashape. Any attempted or purported assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void and without effect. Mashape may assign these Terms without your prior written consent. These Terms will be binding and inure to the benefit of such assignees, transferees, and other successors in the interest of the parties in the event of an assignment or other transfer made consistent with the provisions of these Terms.

Severability

If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of these Terms will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by these Terms is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify these Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled.
