# Overview

Welcome to the Kong official documentation, that will help you setting up Kong, configuring it and operating it. We reccomend reading every section of this document to have a full understanding of the project.

If you have more specific questions about Kong, please join us on [Gitter][gitter-url] and the project maintainers will be happy to answer any of your questions.

## What is Kong?

Kong is a scalable, lightweight, open source API Layer (also called *API Gateway* or *API Middleware*) that runs in front of any RESTful API and provides additional functionalities to the underlying APIs.

APIs running behind Kong can be empowered with [Kong plugins](#plugins) that provide extra functionality and services beyond the core Kong platform. Some of the most popular plugins are: authentication, rate limiting, logging, and more. You can also build your own plugins that other people can use on top of their Kong installation.

Built on top of reliable technologies like nginx and Cassandra, Kong itself provides an easy to use RESTful API that you will use to operate and configure the system.

Kong has been built following three foundamental principles:

* **Scalable**: it's easy to scale horizontally just by adding more machines. It can virtually handle any load for any kind of API while keeping the latency low.
* **Expandable**: it can be expanded by adding new plugins that can be easily configured through an internal RESTful API.
* **Runs on any infrastructure**: It can run in any cloud or on-premise environment, in a single or multi-datacenter setup, for any kind of API: public, private or invite-only APIs.

### Request Workflow

To better understand the system, this is a typical request workflow of an API that uses Kong:
<br>
![](/assets/images/docs/kong-simple.png)
<br>
Once Kong is running, every request being made to the API will hit Kong first, and then it will be proxied to the final API. In between requests and responses Kong will execute any plugin that you decided to install, empowering your APIs.

##How does it work?

Kong is made of two different components, that are easy to set up and to scale independently:

* The **Kong Server**, based on a modified version of the widely adopted **nginx** server, that processes the API requests.
* An underlying **Datastore** for storing operational data, **Apache Cassandra**, which is being used by major companies like Netflix, Comcast or Facebook and it's known for being highly scalable.

Kong needs to have both these components set up and operational. A typical Kong installation can be summed up with the following picture:
<br>

<br>
Don't worry if you are not experienced with these technologies, Kong works out of the box and you or your engineering team will be able to set it up quickly without issues. Feel free to contact us for any technical question.

### Kong Server

The Kong Server, built on top of **nginx**, is the server that will actually process the API requests and execute the configured plugins to provide additional functionalities to the underlying APIs before proxying the request to the final destination.

The Proxy Server listens on two ports, that by default are:

* Port `8000`, that will be used to process the API requests.
* Port `8001`, called **admin port**, provides the Kong's internal API that you can use to operate Kong, and should be private and firewalled.

Kong's internal API listening on the **admin port** is a RESTful API that can be used to configure Kong, create new users, and a handful of other operations. This makes it extremely easy to integrate Kong with existing systems, and it also enables beautiful user experiences: for example when implementing an API-Key provisioning flow, a website can directly communicate with Kong for the credentials provisioning.

### Datastore

Kong Server requires Apache Cassandra running alongside the Proxy Server. It is being used to store data that will be used by the server to function properly, like APIs, Accounts and Applications data, besides metrics used internally. Kong won't function without a running Cassandra instance/cluster.

Cassandra has been chosen because is easy to scale up and down just by adding or removing nodes, and because it can be deployed in lots of different environments, from a single machine to a multi-datacenter cluster.

#Run it for the first time

Running Kong is very easy and will take a couple of minutes. To get started quickly choose between one of the following deployment options:

* [From source]()
* [Docker]()
* Vagrant: coming soon.
* AWS: coming soon.

## Plugins

One of the most important concept to understand are Kong Plugins. All the functionalities provided by Kong are served by easy to use **plugins**: authentication, rate-limiting, logging features are provided through an authentication plugin, a rate-limiting plugin, and a logging plugin among the others. You can decide which plugin to install and how to configure them through the Kong's RESTful internal API.

A Plugin is code that's being executed into the life-cycle of both requests and responses.

By having Plugins, Kong can be extended to fit any custom need or integration challenge. For example, if you need to integrate the API user authentication with a third-party enterprise security system, that would be implemented in a dedicated Plugin that will run on every API request. More advanced users can build their own plugins, to extend the functionalities of Kong.

# Datastores

Technically Kong can be expanded to support many different datastores. Although this is a possiblity, for the time being we'll provide support for Apache Cassandra, which is also the best option for starting small and scaling big.

In the future we may introduce support for SQL datastores like MySQL or Posgres, or for NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

#  Configuration

Kong comes with two configuration files that you can find in the `config.default` folder:

* `kong.yml` stores Kong's configuration for communicating with the database, and for enabling/disabling plugins on the system.
* `nginx.conf` is the typical nginx configuration file that stores all the properties for the HTTP server

You will need to provide both files to run Kong.

## kong.yml

A typical `kong.yml` file looks like:

```yaml
# Specify the DAO to use
database: cassandra

# Enabled plugins
plugins_enabled:
  - authentication
  - ratelimiting
  - networklog

databases_available:
  cassandra:
    properties:
      hosts: "127.0.0.1"
      port: 9042
      timeout: 1000
      keyspace: kong
      keepalive: 60000
```

The `plugins_enabled` array describes the plugins that the server should support system-wide (the order is irrelevant). Then you can configure which Plugin to install to which API by using the `/plugins/` API endpoint. Plugins that haven't been added to `plugins_enabled` won't be executed.

# Scalability

When it comes down to scaling Kong, you need to keep in mind that you will need to scale both the API server and the underlying datastore.

## Kong Server

Scaling the Kong Server up or down is very easy. Each server is stateless and you can just add or remove nodes under the load balancer. Under the hood the API server is built on top of nginx, and scaling is as simple as that.

Be aware that terminating a node might kill the ongoing API requests on that server, so you want to make sure that before killing an API Server all the HTTP requests have been already processed.

## Cassandra

Scaling Cassandra won't be required often, and usually a 2 nodes setup per datacenter is going to be enough for most of the use cases, but of course if your load is going to be very high then you might consider configuring it properly and prepare the cluster to be scaled in order to handle more requests.

The easy part is that Cassandra can be scaled up and down just by adding or removing nodes to the cluster, and the system will take care of re-balancing the data in the cluster.

# Internal API Endpoints

Kong offers a RESTful API that you can use to operate the system. You can run the API commands on any node in the cluster, and Kong will keep the configuration consistent across all the other servers. The default **admin port** is `8001`. Below is the API documentation.

## API Object

The API object describes an API that's being exposed by Kong. In order to do that Kong needs to know what is going to be the DNS address that will be pointing to the API, and what is the final target URL of the API where the requests will be proxied. Kong can serve more than one API domain.

### Delete API

**Endpoint**

## Plugin Object

The Plugin object represents a plugin that will be executed during the HTTP request/response workflow, and it's how you can add functionalities to an API that runs behind Kong, like Authentication or Rate Limiting. Plugins have a configuration `value` field that requires a JSON object representing the plugin configuration.

By default creating a Plugin and adding it to an API will enforce the same Plugin value to every user and Application consuming the API. Sometimes the Plugin configuration needs to be tuned to different values for some specific applications.

For example let's say that the Rate Limiting Plugin for an API is set to 20 requests per minute, but it needs to be increased for some specific Applications. In Kong it's possible to do that by creating a new Plugin object specifying the optional `application_id` field, that will override global configuration of the same Plugin for that specific API.

### Create Plugin

**Endpoint**

`POST /plugins/`

**Request Form Parameters**

* `name` - The name of the Plugin that's going to be added. The Plugin should have already been installed in every Kong server separately.
* `api_id` - The API ID that the Plugin will target
* `value` *optional* - The JSON configuration required for the Plugin. Each Plugin will have different configuration fields, so check the relative Plugin documentation to know which fields you can set.
* `application_id` *optional* - An optional Application ID to customize the Plugin behavior when an incoming request is being sent by the specified Application. This configuration takes precedence over the global API configuration.

**Response**:

```
HTTP 201 Created
```
