## Contributing code and documentation changes

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to Kong, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing too much code.

The process for contributing to any of the Kong repositories is similar. Details for individual projects can be found below:

---

### Fork and clone the repository

You will need to fork the main Kong code or documentation repository and clone it to your local machine. See [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help.

Further instructions for specific projects are given below.

### Submitting your changes

Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:

#### 1. Test Your Changes

Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken.

#### 2. Sign the Contributor License Agreement

Please make sure you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/Mashape/kong). We are not asking you to assign copyright to us, but to give us the right to distribute your code without restriction. We ask this of all contributors in order to assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code. You only need to sign the CLA once.

#### 3. Rebase Your Changes

Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main Kong repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits. This makes them easier to review. As a final step before merging we will either ask you to squash all commits yourself or we’ll do it for you.

#### 4. Submit a Pull Request

Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main Kong repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits. This makes them easier to review.
